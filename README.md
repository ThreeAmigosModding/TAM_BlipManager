# TAM_BlipManager
Our blip management resource allows server owners (thats you ðŸ˜› ) to create, reload and otherwise manage all of the blips on your server to reduce redundant code &amp; have all of them in one easy-to-use resource. Easily create blips in-game with the included clean interface courtesy of ox_lib and then see them reload in real time!
